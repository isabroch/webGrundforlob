        <h2>Formation and early releases (2012–14)</h2>
        <p>PVRIS formed in Lowell, Massachusetts in 2012 under the name Paris. Their line-up consists of vocalist/guitarist Lynn Gunn (born Lyndsey Gunnulfsen), guitarist Alex Babinski, and bassist Brian Macdonald. On March 26, 2013, PVRIS releasedtheir self-titled EP. They played sporadic shows through the Spring including a successful mini-tour.</p>
        <p>During the summer of 2013, the band played a week on Ernie Ball's Battle of the Bands stage at Warped Tour after winning a contest. It was also during this time, on July 26, that they officially changed their name from ‘Paris’ to ‘PVRIS’,citing legal reasons. Coincidentally, the 'V' as a replacement for 'U' was similar to that of the band Chvrches, which also frequently has its name stylized in capital letters; however, Chvrches changed their name for online searchability,not legal issues as was the case with Paris. The band went on The Rise Up Tour supporting A Skylit Drive in September and October. PVRIS began teasing fans that they would soon be hitting the studio to write and record new material aroundthis time. That recording process began in December when PVRIS entered the studio with Blake Harnage of Versa. On February 7, 2014 they officially announced that they were a part of an Acoustic 4 Way Split with A Loss For Words, Wind InSails and After Tonight which was set to release on April 1, 2014. Coinciding with the release of their Acoustic EP, PVRIS joined A Loss For Words, Veara, City Lights, and Moms on the 5th anniversary of The Kids Can’t Lose Tour from March29, 2014 to April 13, 2014.</p>

        <h2>White Noise (2014–2016)</h2>
        <p>When the band went into the studio their sound changed drastically, incorporating pop and electronic elements into their music. Gunn claimed this incorporation was done subconsciously. In June 2014 it was announced the band had signed toRise and Velocity. A music video was released for <em>St. Patrick</em> on June 24, and the song was also released as a single on the same day. In an interview with The Huffington Post Gunn elaborated on the excitement that came with beingable to release new music to the public. <q>We've been waiting over six months to release anything… It feels incredible to finally unleash it to the world. So many more people are into it than we even imagined!</q> The band played two weekson the Battle of the Bands stage at Warped Tour. During their time spent on Warped Tour The Huffington Post released a second article listing them as one of <q>18 Artists You Need To Know Halfway Through 2014</q>. <q>Lynn Gunn is a forcethat cannot be denied, redolently poignant in both her most excitable and serene vocalizations. The first female-led signing of Rise Records, a label that has almost implausibly made metalcore music equally accessible and desirable, thelabel may have just made its smartest acquisition yet.</q></p>
        <p>The band supported Mayday Parade in October and November on their The Honeymoon Tour. In early September, the band supported Emarosa on the Up Close and Personal tour. PVRIS also joined the Ice Grills 2014 Tour in Japan from September 16,2014 to September 21, 2014.
