            <h2>Broken Social Scene: "Broken Social Scene"</h2>
            <p>After a year of recording and writing, Broken Social Scene is a fine distillation of all the band's ambitions. Hands-in-the-air anthems, daydream comedowns, sprawling jams -- this is a long, winding road of a record that goes places to which even BSS are surprised to have arrived.</p>

           <p>"Lush, poetic and beautifully disorienting, BSS guitar guru Andrew Whitemanâ€™s long-awaited solo spin is like smoking hash and eating mangoes on a beach in Xanadu, a trip to some sleepwalking spacious state where bossa meets Buckley and Ribot rolls dice with beat poets."

           <h2>The Most Serene Republic: "Population"</h2>
           <p>The album was self-produced by the band in Toronto over the last year, and was inspired by the sprawling suburbs of their hometown of Milton, Ontario. Musically, they sound as grandiose as ever. On Population, they showcase their prog and jazz influence, while building on the unique sound they carved out with their Arts &nbsp; Crafts debut, Underwater Cinematographer. </p>
