  For centuries, the greatest sailors in the world masterfully navigated the vast Pacific, discovering the many islands of Oceania. But then, 3,000 years ago, their voyages stopped for a millennium – and no one knows exactly why. From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes “Moana,” a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who is inspired to leave the safety and security of her island on a daring journey to save her people. Inexplicably drawn to the ocean, Moana (voice of Auliʻi Cravalho) convinces the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson) to join her mission, and he reluctantly helps her become a wayfinder like her ancestors who sailed before her. Together, they voyage across the open ocean on an action-packed adventure, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills her quest and discovers the one thing she’s always sought: her own identity. Directed by the renowned filmmaking team of Ron Clements and John Musker (“The Little Mermaid,” “Aladdin,” “The Princess & the Frog”), produced by Osnat Shurer (“Lifted,” “One Man Band”), and featuring music by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa‘i, “Moana” sailed into U.S. theaters on Nov. 23, 2016. It is now available to purchase or rent from Amazon Prime, Google Play, and iTunes. Get your copy now!

  The Kakamora are an intense team of crazy, coconut-armored pirates who will stop at nothing to get what they want

  Pua
  Pua is Moana’s loyal pet pig with puppy energy and an innocent playful spirit

  Gramma Tala
  Gramma Tala is Moana’s confidante and best friend, who shares her granddaughter’s special connection to the ocean. Although her son Tui, the chief of Motunui, is a no-nonsense leader, Gramma Tala most definitely dances to the beat of her own drum
  Voiced by Rachel House

  Chief Tui & Sina
  Chief Tui is the gregarious and well-respected leader of the people of Motunui Island, and Moana's father. He wants Moana to follow in his footsteps as leader of their people.
  Sina always has her daughter's back. Playful, sharp and strong-willed, Sina appreciates Moana's longing to be on the water, but also wants to protect her daughter from the fabled dangers beyond the reef
  Voiced by Temuera Morrison and Nicole Scherzinger, repsectively
