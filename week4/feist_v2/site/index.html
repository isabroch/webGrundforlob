      <p>In the summer of 2001, Feist self-produced seven songs at home which she called The Red Demos, which have never been released commercially. She spent more than two years touring throughout Europe with Gonzales. In that same year she and a group of old friends formed Toronto indie rock supergroup <span class="fed">Broken Social Scene</span> and subsequently recorded You Forgot It in People.</p>

      <p>While on tour in Europe with Gonzales, they began recording new versions of her home recorded Red Demos, which would later become her major label debut <span class="fed">Let It Die</span>. Let It Die featured both original compositions and covers, and Feist has been noted both as a songwriter and as an innovative interpreter of other artists' songs.</p>
      <p>After the recording of Let It Die, Feist moved to Paris. While in Europe, she collaborated with Norwegian duo <span class="fed">Kings of Convenience</span> as co-writer and guest vocalist on their album Riot on an Empty Street, as well as co-writing and singing as a duet "The Simple Story" with Jane Birkin on her album Rendezvous.</p>
      <p>Feist toured during 2004, 2005 and 2006 through North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia supporting Let It Die. She won two Canadian <span class="fed">Juno Awards</span> for "Best New Artist" and "Best Alternative Rock Album" in 2004. Sales of Let It Die totaled 500,000 internationally, and she was awarded a platinum record in Canada, as well as a gold album in France.</p>

      <h2><img src="images/cover_reminder.jpg" alt="The Reminder cover">The Reminder</h2>

      <p>The album features "1234", a song co-written by New Buffalo's Sally Seltmann, that became a surprise hit after being featured in a commercial for the iPod nano, hitting #8 in the US, a rare feat for indie rock musicians and even more notable since it hit the Top Ten on the strength of downloads alone. She has been lauded in the press and was featured on the cover of the New York Times arts section in June 2007. The Reminder had sold worldwide over 1,000,000 copies and is certified gold in the U.S. </p>
