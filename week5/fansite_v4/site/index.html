        <p>Lyndsey Gerd Gunnulfsen (born March 15, 1994), usually known by her stage name Lynn Gunn, is an American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. Gunn is best known for fronting the American rock band PVRIS, although she has also made several solo collaborations with artists such as Tonight Alive and A Loss For Words.</p>
        <p>Lyndsey Gunnulfsen grew up in Lowell, Massachusetts. She has spoken about her lifelong fascination with graveyards, death, and the occult, stating that this was the inspiration behind many of the paranormal and macabre themes in her song-writing. Gunn has stated that she has struggled with depression, and that this was a major inspiration for much of her song-writing.</p>
        <p>Gunn is one of the most visible women in rock and a prominent LGBT voice in the alternative music scene. She stated in an interview for Rolling Stone that she first came out as gay to her parents when she was 18, by leaving a letter under her mother's pillow before she went on tour. <q>"First and foremost I want to be known as is an artist and creative before anything else,"</q> she explained in an interview with Playboy. <q>"I think my sexuality is the last thing to check off on that list."</q> Gunn explained her decision to be vocal about her sexuality in an interview with Newsbeat in 2015: <q>"I never had someone to look up to and be like 'oh that person is OK and they're gay.' If I can be that for someone then it's why I'm open about it."</q></p>
        <p>Gunn was one of several artists invited by GLAAD and Billboard to talk about her coming-out story for National Coming Out Day in 2017. Gunn cited her family's supportiveness while she was coming out and encouraged others to reach out for the support around them.</p>
        <p>Gunn presented the Icon Award to Laura Jane Grace of the American punk rock band Against Me! at the 2017 APMA Awards.</p>
