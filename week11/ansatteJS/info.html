    	<p>Moonrise Kingdom is the new movie directed by two-time Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Wes Anderson.</p>
    	<p>Set on an island off the coast of New England in the summer of 1965, Moonrise Kingdom tells the story of two 12-year-olds who fall in love, make a secret pact, and run away together into the wilderness. As various authorities try to hunt them down, a violent storm is brewing off-shore – and the peaceful island community is turned upside down in every which way.</p>
